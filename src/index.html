    The <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">web directions
    conference</a> was amazing this year.  Extremely high quality
    presentations across the board, covering pertinent topics ranging
    from client side persistence to web security, to "object oriented
    css".  Hats off to John Allsopp, the organizer.  But I don't want
    to write about the conference, I'll leave that to someone else.  I
    wanted to dig into an interesting small phenomenon that happened
    at the conference: More than half of the talks I attended
    concluded with a 'Contact Me/More Information' slide that included
    a reference to project source on
    <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.  Not sourceforge.net,
    and not code.google.com, but GitHub.  What the hell is going on?

    Maybe it was a fluke.  Or maybe not:
    <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master">Ruby On Rails</a>,
    the high visibility web application development framework offered source
    on GitHub right when it launched, in April of 2008.
    <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>
    <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/12/08/yuidoc/">announced they
    would move to GitHub</a> in December of 2008.  The
    <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a> "Objective-J"
    framework is hosted on GitHub.  [NOTE: comb github announcements for
    some of the other popular projects on github].  Why have these projects
    chosen git?  Why have they chosen GitHub?

    More news, GitHub
    <a href="http://github.com/blog/289-best-bootstrapped-startup-of-2008">won</a>
    the "Best Bootstrapped Startup of the Year"	award on
    <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, a community 
    based vote.  Let's take it to an emperical popular vote on
    search.yahoo.com: 585 results for "github rocks", 11 turn up for
    "github sucks".  On google trends, we've got something that looks like
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=github">exponential growth</a>.  
    Further, it looks like as many people are now interested in git as are
    interested in subversion in
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=svn%2Cgit&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1">this trend comparison graph</a>.
    Finally, note the recent increase of interest in 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=git&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0">git itself</a> 
    seems primarily driven by the interest around GitHub.  Git, give the Hub a big kiss.  It's safe to call
    this a frenzy, so again, what the hell is going on?  Is all this
    warranted, or is GitHub a fancy boy band that'll be gone tommorrow?
    Maybe it's fear, are we pretending to be interested so we
    don't get called "ugly and stupid" by
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Linus Torvalds</a>,
    git's father?  (ED: he's done some other interesting stuff, I just can't
    recall what right now)

WRITE ME:

  c. lead-in to the two major elements: git and github

3. The utility of git
   a. key "novel" ideas
   b. emperical facts
   c. sample applications and comparision of DVCS with VCS
   d. linus's trojan horse: p4 and svn integration

4. The elegance of github
   a. fork
   b. follow 
   c. push and pull
   d.
   e. github properly follows git, making it's natural features more
      tractable and usable - relate to the recepie for innovation:
      take something unix hackers have done for years and make it
      accessible to the end user
     
5. it ain't all roses
   a. My coworker went crazy, I swear
   b. rough spots, confusions, dangers

6. Wrap up, key reasons why this happened - a combination of
   technical superiority, tool utility, and sociological
   goodness of fit.
