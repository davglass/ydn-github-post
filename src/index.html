<h3> The Git[Hub] Frenzy </h3>

<p>
    The <a href="http://north.webdirections.org/">web directions
    conference</a> was amazing this year.  Extremely high quality
    presentations across the board, covering pertinent topics ranging
    from client side persistence to web security, to "object oriented
    css".  Hats off to John Allsopp, the organizer.  But I don't want
    to write about the conference, I'll leave that to someone else.  I
    wanted to dig into an interesting small phenomenon that happened
    at the conference: More than half of the talks I attended
    concluded with a 'Contact Me/More Information' slide that included
    a reference to project source on
    <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.  Not sourceforge.net,
    and not code.google.com, but GitHub.  What the hell is going on?
</p>
<p>
    Maybe it was a fluke.  Or maybe not:
    <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master">Ruby On Rails</a>,
    the high visibility web application development framework offered source
    on GitHub right when it launched, in April of 2008.
    <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a>
    <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/12/08/yuidoc/">announced they
    would move to GitHub</a> in December of 2008.  The
    <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a> "Objective-J"
    framework is hosted on GitHub.  [NOTE: comb github announcements for
    some of the other popular projects on github].  Why have these projects
    chosen git?  Why have they chosen GitHub?
</p>
<p>
    More news, GitHub
    <a href="http://github.com/blog/289-best-bootstrapped-startup-of-2008">won</a>
    the "Best Bootstrapped Startup of the Year"	award on
    <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, a community 
    based vote.  Let's take it to an emperical popular vote on
    search.yahoo.com: 585 results for "github rocks", 11 turn up for
    "github sucks".  On google trends, we've got something that looks like
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=github">exponential growth</a>.  
    Further, it looks like as many people are now interested in git as are
    interested in subversion in
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=svn%2Cgit&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1">this trend comparison graph</a>.
    Finally, note the recent increase of interest in 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=git&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0">git itself</a> 
    seems primarily driven by the interest around GitHub.
	Git, give the Hub a big kiss.  So now it's really safe to call
    this a <i>frenzy</i>, so again, what the hell is going on?  Is all this
    warranted, or is GitHub a fancy boy band that'll be gone tommorrow?
    Maybe it's fear, are we pretending to be interested so we
    don't get called "ugly and stupid" by
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">Linus Torvalds</a>,
    git's father?  (ED: he's done some other interesting stuff, I just can't
    recall what right now)
</p>
<p>
    I would posit that we engineers are <b>not</b> overly impressed with
	the hot, fresh, and new - that we couldn't be threatened into loving
	something, even by someone as imtimidating as Linus.  So let's give
	ourselves the benefit of the doubt and dig into git a bit, what is so
	interesting about this new revision control system that has us so
	hot and bothered?
	
</p>

<h3> The Utility of Git </h3>

<p>
  Git is the first free <i>Distributed</i> version control system to gain
  widespread popular visibility.  As Linus says, distribution, rather
  than any particular implementation, is the key interesting idea.  So
  how does a distributed version control differ from a centralized system?
  Let's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">turn to wikipedia</a> for this one, here are some key features of
  distributed systems:
  <ul>
   <li> There may be many "central" repositories.
   <li> Code from disparate repositories are merged based on a web of trust, i.e., historical merit or quality of changes.
   <li> Lieutenants are project members who have the power to dynamically decide which branches to merge.
   <li> Network is not involved in most operations.
   <li> A separate set of "sync" operations are available for committing or receiving changes with remote repositories.
  </ul>

  So the essence here is a Distributed system means each checkout pulls
  a full copy of the source repository, for all practical purposes
  indistinguishable from the original.  This behavior provides some
  features and some implementation challenges, first let's look at what we
  get:
  <ul>
    <li> true offline development, because we have our own copy, nearly
	  every feature of the system can be utilized without network
	  connectivity.  
	<li> local commits, branching, and tagging - we can use revision
	  control at every stage of development and only share our changes
	  when ready.
	<li> fast operations - because the network is not involved, pulling
	  blame annotated source, commit statistics, or historical spelunking
	  all can run on the local system.
    <li> redundancy - every checkout produces an organic backup of the
	  central repository
	<li> reduced server load - because the server is involved in a reduced
	  set of operations, it's not working as hard.
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Is this simple idea new for revision control:  Do more on the client? 
  Let's consider a few representative revision control systems over the
  course of time: RCS, CVS, and Subversion.  In RCS there was
  no reasonable notion of checking out source, you worked on the server.
  CVS brought us the ability to check out source, but every revision
  control operation would hit the network.  In subversion a checkout keeps
  a pristine copy of each file so you can do local diffing.  Now git keeps
  the whole history, so you can do local, well, anything.  Framed in this
  way distribution seems a logical evolution.  We've been slowly moving
  more and more data and functionality to the client, and now we've taken
  it to its logical end.
</p>

<p>
  While technical characteristics of distribution are interesting, the
  sociological elements are moreso.  Because a checkout gives you a
  full copy of the source repository, things like "commit priviledges" are
  no longer meaningful.  Everyone may commit to their personal repository.
  No one is special.  If I were to clone a public open source repository,
  and host it somewhere, now I have a copy that's the same as the original,
  and if I do a good job, folks can follow me rather than the original
  author.  [work on this paragraph]

3. The utility of git
   a. key "novel" ideas
   b. emperical facts
   c. sample applications and comparision of DVCS with VCS
   d. linus's trojan horse: p4 and svn integration

4. The elegance of github
   a. fork
   b. follow 
   c. push and pull
   d.
   e. github properly follows git, making it's natural features more
      tractable and usable - relate to the recepie for innovation:
      take something unix hackers have done for years and make it
      accessible to the end user
     
5. it ain't all roses
   a. My coworker went crazy, I swear
   b. rough spots, confusions, dangers

6. Wrap up, key reasons why this happened - a combination of
   technical superiority, tool utility, and sociological
   goodness of fit.
