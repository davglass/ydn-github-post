What is this?

A post on git and github for YDN (yahoo developer network) that I'm working on.
Feel free to fork it and add your thoughts.  all contributors will be credited 
in the final post here: http://developer.yahoo.com/

The goal of this post is to overview the frenzy around git and github, and to 
analyze why this has taken shape.

The post itself will be developed on github.  this is an experiment.
